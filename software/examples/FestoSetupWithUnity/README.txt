INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE SRC WITH UNITY

To run these examples, a Simulink file AND a Unity project need to be used. For all the Unity projects, please go to this GitHub folder: [(https://github.com/FemkevanBeek/SRCwithUnity)].

For all the Unity projects, the same Simulink file, 'mainSimulink_localPi' can be used, which is in the current folder. For each specific use case, some specific settings should be set. Once all the correct settings are selected
in Unity and in Simulink, the Pi should first be started from command line, then Simulink should be started, and finally Unity should be run. For closing down, first stop Unity and then
stop Simulink.

For all settings, the following steps should be used:
- Go to "Modeling/Model Explorer"
- Open "mainSimulink_localPi" in hte Model Hierarchy
- Select "Model Workspace"
- In the "Model Workspace" pane on the right of the screen, set your settings
- Press "Reinitialize from Source" just below the "Model Workspace" pane
- Your new settings should now show up in the middle pane

For all use cases, make sure that these settings match your setup:
- PiAddress 		// (192.168.4.1) for ethernet cable !!!For some reason, this variable does not get propagated to the main Simulink file
			// so, you'll have to type it manually in the 'TCP/IP Send' and 'TCP/IP Receive' blocks.
- PiTCPport		// match what you defined in Python code
- UnityAddress		// (127.0.0.1 for local)
- UnityTCPport		// match what you've defined in Unity
- regulatorMin = -100 	//[kPA] this is the correct range for Festo regulator VEAB-L26-D13-Q4-V1-1R1
- regulatorMax = 100  	//[kPa] this is the corerct range for Festo regulator VEAB-L26-D13-Q4-V1-1R1

In the main Simulink model, the Controller Switch can be used to switch the controller on or off
Currently, sending data back to Unity is disabled because our use cases don't require it, but you can turn it on if you'd like.
If using this setting, also select 'Receiving data' in Unity to actually receive the data, and 'Storing data' if you'd like to save it.

Use case 2: Tele-operation:
%%Robot settings
- dataSize = 3;   		//if you are actuating 3 fingers
- actuatorMin = [0,0,0]  	// [kPa] make sure to adjust array size if you adjust number of fingers
- actuatorMax = [40,40,40]  	// [kPa, see above. Note that each actuator range can be set independently]  
%%Unity communication settings
- nrMessages = 3; 		//keep same as dataSize

Use case 3: VR:
%%Robot settings
- dataSize = 3;   		//if you are actuating 3 fingers
- actuatorMin = [0,0,0]  	// [kPa] make sure to adjust array size if you adjust number of fingers
- actuatorMax = [20,20,20]  	// [kPa, see above. Note that each actuator range can be set independently]
%%Unity communication settings
- nrMessages = 3; 		//keep same as dataSize
