Usage:
python3 runrobot_Festo.py -i <[I2C channels]> -p <Port>

Example:
python3 runrobot_Festo.py -i 1,3 -p 12345

I2C channels indicate the channels to which the VEAB boards are connected. The order of the channels determines the numbering of sensors&actuators.
Sensors and actuators come in pairs (VEAB), and they are counted sequentially:
Channel1VEAB1->Channel1VEAB2->Channel2VEAB1->Channel2VEAB2->....

The Port is the port that TCP/IP uses (must be the same here and MATLAB/Simulink)

The "datasize" variable must be 2*(No. of VEAB boards)
